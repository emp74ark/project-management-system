  <span i18n class="about__item">
    A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed 
    to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize 
    efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams 
    establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, 
    columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and 
    service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it 
    done!
